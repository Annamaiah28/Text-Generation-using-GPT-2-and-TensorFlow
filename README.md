# Text Generation using GPT-2 and TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to generate text using the **GPT-2** model with **TensorFlow** and the **Hugging Face Transformers** library. GPT-2 is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI, capable of generating human-like text based on a given prompt.

## Overview
This project uses the pre-trained GPT-2 model from Hugging Face's Transformers library to generate text. The model is fine-tuned for text generation tasks, and the script provides an easy-to-use interface for generating text based on a user-provided prompt.

Key features:
- Text generation using GPT-2.
- Customizable parameters like `max_length`, `temperature`, `top_k`, and `top_p`.
- Save the model and tokenizer for future use.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers library

---

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-generation-gpt2.git
   cd text-generation-gpt2

## Install the required libraries:
pip install tensorflow transformers

## Usage
To generate text using the GPT-2 model, run the provided Python script:


python text_generation_using_gpt_2_and_tensorflow.py

## Customizing the Script
You can modify the following parameters in the script:

- prompt: The input text prompt for generating text.

- max_length: The maximum length of the generated text.

- temperature: Controls the randomness of the output (lower values make the output more deterministic).

- top_k: Limits the sampling pool to the top-k most likely tokens.

- top_p: Implements nucleus sampling, where the model considers the smallest possible set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds top_p.

Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the script:

# Example prompt
prompt = "Once upon a time"

# Generate text
generated_text = generate_text(prompt, max_length=50)
print("Generated Text:", generated_text)

## Sample Output

Generated Text: Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a brave knight who embarked on a quest to save the kingdom from an evil dragon. Along the way, he encountered many challenges...

Saving the Model and Tokenizer
The script allows you to save the GPT-2 model and tokenizer for future use. The model and tokenizer are saved in the gpt2_model and gpt2_tokenizer directories, respectively.

# Save the model
model.save_pretrained("gpt2_model")

# Save the tokenizer
tokenizer.save_pretrained("gpt2_tokenizer")
